This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Recipes Requirements - This project is implemented with React hooks, please use hooks to complete the objectives
This is a mock recipe site. This site displays a single recipe currently -- Chocolate Chip Cookies.

### Front end sets
### Set A
* Add a feature that allows users to anonymously add comments on any of the recipe steps or ingredients
* The ability for any user to anonymously upvote a comment must be available
* The comments and votes do not need to be visible to other users on the site, but it would be a nice-to-have if they persisted for the given browser's session.

### Backend sets
### Set A
* Create a mock array of ingredients for the front end to fetch complete with endpoints to fetch
* Create crud endpoints that can interact with the mock array
* Bonus for creating swagger endpoints
### All Sets
* You can be as creative as you wish as to how you implement these features
* The finished app may or may not be styled
