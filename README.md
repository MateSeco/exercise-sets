This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Recipes Requirements - This project is implemented with React hooks, please use hooks to complete the objectives
This is a mock recipe site. This site displays a single recipe currently -- Chocolate Chip Cookies.  Please pick and complete 2 of the below 3 sets of requirements.

### Front end sets
### Set A
* Add a feature that allows users to anonymously add comments on any of the recipe steps or ingredients
* The ability for any user to anonymously upvote a comment must be available
* The comments and votes do not need to be visible to other users on the site, but it would be a nice-to-have if they persisted for the given browser's session.

### Set B
* Add the ability for a user to increase/decrease the serving size (for example a user wants to bake 36 cookies instead of 24)
* The ingredient amounts should re-calculate on change
* Integrating with redux or react context will be a plus

### Set C
* Add the ability for a user to add a new recipe to the app
* The recipe should be persisted on page refresh (local storage is acceptable)
* Integrating with redux or react context will be a plus

### Backend sets
### Set A
* Create a mock array of ingredients for the front end to fetch complete with endpoints to fetch
* Create crud endpoints that can interact with the mock array
* Bonus for creating swagger endpoints

### Set B
* Create a mock array of users.
* Create an additional attribute called likes on ingredients and create an endpoint that decrement & increment the amount of likes a recipe has
* Bonus for creating swagger endpoints 

### All Sets
* You can be as creative as you wish as to how you implement these features
* The finished app may or may not be styled
